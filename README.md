Collaboration Room Demo

This is a demonstration for Harveen to show her how a Git
repo hosted on GitHub could help her manage the issues and
versions of software in use in the Sabre collaboration rooms.

The idea that I have would be to create a branch for each
room and, at minimum place a different README file in each 
branch as a placeholder file. Then, she could use the GitHub
website to keep-up with issues in each room. Since GitHub 
repos can be made visible to the public, this would give her
a way to collaborate with the vendor on the status of issues
and current version of software / fixes in each room.

This coule be taken a step further by actually asking the
vendor of the collaboration room software to actually check-in
the current version of their software for each room in the 
corresponding branch.
